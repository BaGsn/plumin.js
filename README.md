What is this?
=============

It's a tool to ***create and manipulate fonts using javascript***.

We hope that the interactive, connected, hackable nature of the web
will bring more type-design enthusiasts to font-scripting,
while enabling new ways to design and use fonts.

If you're into analogies and technical details, it intends to be an alternative
to [RoboFab](http://robofab.org/): it's a ***font-oriented 2D API and scene-graph with OpenType export capabilities***.
It's built on top of [paper.js](http://paperjs.org)
and [opentype.js](https://github.com/nodebox/opentype.js).
It can run in the browser (in a [WebWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker) for optimal performances)
or in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Status
------

Plumin.js is a work in progress and should be considered in alpha state
(it still lacks OpenType import and UFO import/export).
It's a Free and Open-Source Software, MIT licensed and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/byte-foundry/plumin.js)
(a cozy place where free-range code thrives, and [bugs are hunted down](https://github.com/byte-foundry/plumin.js/issues)).

It's developped in parallel with [Prototypo](http://prototypo.io),
an online app that uses parametric typefaces to design fonts faster.
You can expect frequent updates and improvements in Plumin.js and upstream projects it uses.
